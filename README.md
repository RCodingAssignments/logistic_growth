I have used the experiment two data for this analysis. 

1. In a closed system, population growth, or logistic growth, comprises four stages, lag, log, stationary and decline. During lag phase, the organisms aclimatise to the environment and are preparing for growth, such as through protein synthesis. In contast, the log phase characterises eponential growth, where all, if any, limitng factors and density-independent. Alternatively, when the population reaches carrying capacity (stationary growth) density-depdendent limiting factors, such as nutrient depletion and a lack of space restict increased population growth. When death exceeds growth, the population is in the decline phase. There are various paramaters of interest one could measure regarding logsitic growth- in this analysis, I focus on N0, r and, k. N0 is the initial population size, r is the intrinsi growth rate and k is the carrying capacity. 

Logistic growth can be modelled by the equation: dN/dt=Nr(1-(N/k)). Solving for N(t) produces the differential equation that defines N(t) as a function of N0, r and, k. Therefore, this differential cannot be used to estimate our paramters of intersest, as such parameters are necessary terms in the equation. We must restrict the time over which we model N(t) to reduce the number of paramters necessary. 

Estimating r and N0-
The lag and log phases of logistic growth, when K<N0 and t is small, is the exponential phase of growth. When considering this inequality and the fact that t is small, the N(t) equation is simplified to N(t)=N0e^rt. We can then apply a linear approximation to this equation, to convert it into a more usable form. By taking the natural logarithm of both sides of the equation, ln(Nt)=ln(N0)+rtln(e). As ln(e)=1, ln(Nt)=ln(N0)+rt. The equation of a linear line is y=mx+b therefore, our linear approximation defines m (the gradient) as r and, b (the y-intercept) as ln(N0). In my analysis, 

Estimating k-
