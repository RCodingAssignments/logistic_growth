I have used the experiment two data for this analysis. 

1. In a closed system, population growth, or logistic growth, comprises four stages, lag, log, stationary and decline. During lag phase, the organisms aclimatise to the environment and are preparing for growth, such as through protein synthesis. In contast, the log phase characterises eponential growth, where all, if any, limitng factors and density-independent. Alternatively, when the population reaches carrying capacity (stationary growth) density-depdendent limiting factors, such as nutrient depletion and a lack of space restict increased population growth. When death exceeds growth, the population is in the decline phase. There are various paramaters of interest one could measure regarding logsitic growth- in this analysis, I focus on N0, r and, k. N0 is the initial population size, r is the intrinsi growth rate and k is the carrying capacity. 

Logistic growth can be modelled by the equation

Estimating r and N0-

Estimating k-
